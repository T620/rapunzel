				Once upon a time… in a city named Amityville. In an area known to locals as ‘El Gueto’ which is ‘Ghetto’ in spanish, due to it’s high crime rate and low income mostly due to an abundance of illegal drugs. El Gueto consisted of three highrise buildings each control by a different drug-lord. Located in the lower bowels of ‘Block C’ the tallest of the megastructure, lived a humble couple that were destined to be future parents. The depressive state of living conditions with the gang controlled megastructure doesn’t leave many options for the married couple, especially since they fit all the criteria, low income and no aspirations of escaping their prison-like lifestyle.
			</p>
			<p>
				Rapunzel was the widely taken drug in block C. Inserted like eye-drops it would have instant effect on the individual, slowing down the person's perception of time. The effects of taking Rapunzel had devastating effects on block C’s community. Widely consumed by the residents in the block it tore through the heart of the community, ruining the futures of many. Once taken Rapunzel grabs hold of the individual's mind and causes severe hallucination. This highly addictive drug changes the personality of the individual so much so they would not appear the same to family or friends.
			</p>
			<p>
				As with many people within El Gueto, they found themselves turning to other inlets - the mother-to-be caught herself addicted to the gang controlled substance rapunzel. Day to day life became increasingly difficult for the future father as the addiction grew to unsustainable levels. Struggling, the father would have to find other methods other than paying for the substance with the little money they had… this would eventually cause him to take desperate measures.

				The husband would spent many hours worrying over his wife's condition as it progressively got worse and worse. The level of rapunzel now needed to maintain the wife’s addiction was beyond what they could afford, so the wife started having withdrawal symptoms. The first week the wife started to have cold sweats during her sleep, the husband worried and stayed up watching over her. After the sweats came the sleepless nights due to the nightmarish hallucinations keeping the husband on constant alert, worrying every second about her well-being. On the sixth week of the hellish withdrawal period the husband had finally had enough, he was going to get enough rapunzel to help calm his wife’s addiction and more importantly save the couples relationship. No matter what the cost…

				Outside the couple's flat consisted a network of narrow and complex corridors that connected the many other small dingy flats together, at key points of corridor connections there would usually be low level gang members distributing the drug needed to fulfill the wife’s dependency. Late one night, the husband ventured outside the flat to find one of these gang members.

				Block C consisted a network of narrow and complex corridors that connected the many other small dingy flats together with the couples. At key points where corridors would intersect there would usually be low level gang members distributing the drug needed to fulfill the wife’s dependency. Late one night, although unless you were located on the edges of the megacomplex you would have to trust your watch - the husband ventured outside the flat to find one of these gang members, his intentions were devious as he did not plan to pay the dealer… After the long trip through the maze he finally ended up at his destination, the dealers distribution point, “This is has to be the place”. He anxiously waits for the opportune moment to strike, his sinister plan involved taking what he needed by force. During a dry spell the dealer decided to watch some sort of video on what looked like a hand held device. The husband sneaked his way over approaching the dealer slowly tightly grasping his laser taser, he took aim and fired - A direct hit. He scurried over closing the last of the distance between them and searched the dealer for what he found, “Bingo, Just what I was looking for”.

				The husband was victorious, he had achieved the crutches needed to escape another week of his wife's withdrawal terrors. After returning home, the husband started preparations to fulfill his wife's dependencies - the crackling noise from the preparations were canceled out due the wives insurfritible screaming. Three bangs, “The door?” thought the husband - Instantly after he heard a recognisable voice, “Now now, Don’t make be break the door down”. The husband hesitantly moved towards the door, doubtful of his safety muttered, “I’m sorry! I’ll give you back what we took” - Before the husband could even touch the door’s locking mechanism he was blown back from what he could only describe as a rocket to the face.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Do you mind if we come in?”, It was the druglord and a few of his goons - One of goons picked the husband to his feet and sat him on the bed where his suffering wife was lying down crying with pain. The drug lord took a look around whilst the two bulky men acted as a watch, keeping an eye on the husband and crippled wife, “Right so let’s keep this simple, give me back what you’ve taken and we might leave you with all your fingers”, the drug lord made his demand in an eloquent but malevolent manner - The husband replied stuttering “I-I Already S-Started prep-preparations”. The drug lord took a glance over at the couple's kitchen and then replied, “Well I guess the fingers are going on the chopping board”. The goons immediately reached for the man's wife, The man instinctively tried to stop them knowing fine well of what consequences would be dished out, “Take me!” He pleaded - “You? What would be the fun in that”, The goons pushed him to the floor revealing to the drug lord his pregnant wife, it was clear to him that she was suffering from withdrawals, “This must the be the motive for stealing my Rapunzel, You must value her life more than your own”, The druglord stared at her with his vicious gaze only to be interrupted by the husbands howl, “Please! She has our unborn child! Take me leave here out of this she had no part” - The goon punched the the husband in the gut, rendering him incapable of movement.
			</p>
			<p>
				The drug lord then gave the husband an ultimatum, “Either find me the money you owe me in exchange for forgiveness or face the consequences. ” - The consequences were known to the couple as the gang was notorious in block C.

				The ultimatum was given, the husband had to make a choice, either face the consequences or somehow come up with the money. The husband knew of the gang, the gang only known as ‘The Coyotes’ - They have total control over Block C, they ruled with an iron fist, punishing any who stepped up against them. The husband after witnessing his neighbours segmentation. They took his arms, legs, torso and head and placed up and down the corridor as a warning to others to not defy ‘The Coyotes’.
			</p>
			<p>
				The druglord approached the husband and crouched down to his level and said softly said, “I don’t have all day, If you can’t come up with the money I’ll be getting big John over here”, The husband looks over to one of the henchmen and notices him grasping an electrified object - sword shaped, The husband fears the worst has yet to come.
			</p>
			<p>
				The gang would rarely make their way down to the lower levels of the mega-complex as its condition were poor at best. Disease was rife, the mountains of trash concealed the solid steel walls, and packs of wild coyotes that make their way through the block from large entrances located at the bottom floor - taking anything left by the residents. The Coyotes, people believe the gang based their ideology on that of the wild animals themselves.
			</p>
			<p>
				A shining light came from the brutes weapon, as he raised his armed hand to the ceiling, “Please! Don’t hurt my wife, she's suffering already, please give us something to help her get through this”, Exclaimed the husband - The drug lord, ‘El Papi’, glanced back over towards the wife, “Hmm… How about this, I’ll give you a lifetime supply of Rapunzel for your unborn child?”. The husband looked stunned and was left with no choice… The agreement was made.

				Time came and went and the birth finally came, they had had a baby girl, not long after the birth came the inevitable - ‘The Coyotes’ eventually got wind of the event and snatched the baby from the couple. The child then grew to become a beautiful and attractive young women. ‘The Coyotes’ looked after their property very well, for one could not determine the difference between Rapunzel and that of a successful business woman, for she was dressed like this to appear inconspicuous. Rapunzel had splendid hair, as fine as spun gold, she was decorated in jewelry and the latest fashion trends, which was surprising, given that she transferred drugs for ‘The Coyotes’.

			<p>
				Her living conditions were also relatively comfortable. Although she had a place to call her own, in a way it was a prison cell. She had no interaction with the outside world. The only time she could feel the warm grace of the sun on her face was in the morning before her ‘chores’ start. She would often stare out the window and look at all the little lights. It gave her hope that one day she would be free, to experience everything one should experience.

				Block C was surrounded by suburbs, these were higher income residents. Just outside Block C was the police station, they housed the criminal investigation team, the team were tasked with human trafficking and narcotics. Block C became notorious for drug trafficking and production, the team knew ‘The Coyotes’ and their leader ‘El Papi’ were up to something that involved the drug Rapunzel but couldn’t make a move due to their lack of evidence. One detective who was making the biggest splash in the office was Det. Johnson, he was making major breakthroughs. Johnson was an undercover detective, he was a man who stuck by the law - the law always came first in his eyes. He was disguised as a low level member of the Coyote gang but and due to his loyalty towards the gang Johnson had recently been promoted - This promotion would give him access to the upper levels of the gang controlled, Block C.
			</p>
			<p>
				Three weeks into Johnson’s investigation he noticed a girl that ‘El Papi’ was calling Rapunzel. Johnson had taken quite a liken to Rapunzel as she seemed to be different to the rest of the gang members - she didn’t follow the same mannerisms - her beauty looked untainted, she had a uplifting aura... she just seemed out of place to the detective. She seemed to be working for the drug lord, but he couldn’t figure out what her role was. When Johnson was on guard duty outside of the drug lords quarters, he noticed that Rapunzel would enter ‘El Papi’s’ room early in the morning and stay in for around 10 minutes before leaving - He made the observation that her hair would change styles, Johnson pondered “it almost looked like her hair is being used to conceal… That’s it!” John had made a revelation, she was using her hair to traffic the drugs, the detectives heart was torn - Rapunzel was one of the main cogs within the drug trafficking operation and was the key the investigations needed to take down ‘El Papi’.

				Det. Johnson would spend the next couple days spectating Rapunzel as she would complete the same routine; arrive at ‘El Papi’s’ apartment - Pick up a shipment - Leave. One day Rapunzel didn’t come to the drug lords chambers, he found this alarming as this routine had been consistent for the last 10 days. Whilst on guard duty Johnson was just about to complete his first patrol but he made a strange discovery, a long stream of fine blonde hair was on the floor - he decided to investigate to see where the hair leads. He followed the golden pathway down several corridors in till it reached a apartment with the door wide open. He made his way towards the apartment only to find Rapunzel battered and bloodied up, Johnson rushed over to her to find out what had happened, “Are you ok?”, she replied in a worried fashion, “He’s coming back, run” - Johnson picked up Rapunzel as she was incapable of moving before started to leave. When he reached the doorway a familiar figure blocked him from leaving - “Going somewhere?”, It was the drug lord, ‘El Papi’. Johnson tried to explain himself but before he could get a word out ‘El Papi’ whipped out his ray gun and pressed it up against Johnson's side, “Put her down, and i’ll think about letting you live another day.” - Johnson, without hesitation replied, “How could you allow this to happen to your own daughter!” The drug lord laughingly replied, “My daughter? She’s not my daughter, just our residential mule and that's what she gets for not following orders”. Johnson side was punctured by ‘El Papi’, rendering him unable to move - Johnson sputtered, “Why does she call you her father then?”, ‘El Papi’ looked down towards Johnson and smirked - “We took her as part of a deal”. Johnson blacked out.

				Johnson awoke. He was at the base of Block C lying outside the large gaping entrance, coyotes were rampant, he was dazed and confused - “What happened?”, he thought. He got up and pain from his left side set in, he stumbled back to the ground. He noticed he was bleeding just above his hip, time was against him, he pushed himself to get up and start walking. He made his way to the police station which was around 30 minutes from where he was during his journey he started to remember what had happened, Rapunzel needed his help.
			</p>
			<p>
				He arrived at the reception desk, no one seemed to recognise him, he was still in character, overgrown facial hair, raggedy clothing - He yelped in pain “Where the Chief, I need to speak with him”, the receptionist curiously replied, “Johnson? Is that you?” - Johnson fainted. The crew got him medical attention and Johnson woke up 6 hours later, he was in hospital. He got up and got dressed, the nursed tried to stop him but he had a mission, he had to save Rapunzel. He made his way back to the station and explained the situation the chief, throwing out demands, “Listen chief we need to get in there and rescue her, she’s not part of their operation she's being held captive against her will - He’s beating her for christ sake”, the chief stood up and raised his voice, “We’re not going to risk 5 years of undercover work for one girl that you’ve obviously developed feelings for, the risk is too much! Return home and get some rest” - Johnson stormed out of the building with one thing on his mind, “I must rescue Rapunzel.”

				The rescue mission… Johnson had one objective, one goal - Rescue Rapunzel. He was going to let nothing stop him, he wasn’t scared of ‘El Papi’ or his gang, he didn’t care about the chief or his job he just had to rescue her, Rapunzel. Johnson made the agonising trek through lower slums towards his apartment - he got in and suited up, getting into his well constructed disguise and equipping his electro-blade. He started to make his way towards Block C, Mega-Complex cast a shadow that stretched hundreds of foot, darkening his path towards the tower. Johnson reached the base of the structure only to realise the task that was in front of him, he had to scale the block and somehow get past ‘The Coyotes’. Johnson powered through the structure meeting none of ‘The Coyotes’, everything was going smoothly and Johnson wound no longer phased him as he only only had one thing on his mind. The closer he got the the gang’s HQ the more corner-merchants (drug dealers) he would find, most of the corner-merchants recognised him as part of the gang making getting passed them easy. Johnson had reached his first security point, down the corridor was one brute, sleeping on the job - Johnson still fueled with rage didn’t wait. He scuffled over to the sleeping gang member, he knew exactly what had to be done… With one fast swipe the gang member evaporated, the end was near.

				Johnson pushed forward taking out anyone in his path in stealthy like manner before finally reaching his goal - the final floor. Johnson rushed towards Rapunzels door only to find a empty room. He knew if El Papi had her he could never win, he had an army with him at all times, all seemed lost. Johnson felt a cool breeze coming from the window, it was open, in fact it had been smashed. He approached the window only to find Rapunzel’s hair tied to the the frame - Johnson's mind jumps to worst case scenario, he looks out the windows towards the ground and is ecstatic with what he sees. About 6 floors down is a girl abseiling using her hair, Johnson shouts “Rapunzel!”, Rapunzel looked up and in a panicking fashion smashed a window on her currently level and forced her way into their apartment - In relief Johnson said, “She was safe”. Johnson climbed outside the window and grabbed hold of Rapunzel’s hair - he made his way down the structure trying not to look down. He stumbled inside the apartment where Rapunzel entered, she was on the ground unconscious. Johnson quickly approached Rapunzel and grabbed her, “Rapunzel, Wake up - Your safe!” She opened her eyes, “Aren't you working for my father?” - “Rapunzel he’s not your father, I’m an undercover detective - I’m here to rescue you!”. Rapunzel immediately changed, like a wave of relief washed over, she looked at the detective and said “Let's get out of here”.

				Johnson picked up Rapunzel and started to make his way down the levels of ‘El Papi’s’ fort trying to avoid all points of danger. When he reached the stairwell down to the previous floor ‘El Papi’ was blocking the only way out, Johnson looked ‘El Papi’ dead in the eyes and said, “Get out the way, scum - I’ve seen enough”. ‘El Papi” moved towards Johnson, Johnson could see a ‘El Papi’ wielding a shining blade, he gently laid down Rapunzel and unsheathe his elctro-blade. ‘El Papi’ raised his sword and before he could strike his body was pierced by Johnson - ‘El Papi’ was no more, he had been defeated. Johnson had won and Rapunzel was safe.
