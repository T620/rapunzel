		<p>Once upon a time… in a city named Amityville. In an area known to locals as El Gueto. El Gueto consisted of three highrise buildings each control by a different drug-lord. Located in the lower bowels of Block A, the tallest of the megastructure, lived a humble couple that were destined to be future parents. The depressive state of living conditions with the gang controlled megastructure doesn’t leave many options for the married couple, especially since they fit all the criteria, low income and no aspirations of escaping their prison-like lifestyle.</p>
		<p>As with many people within El Gueto, they found themselves turning to other inlets - the mother-to-be caught herself addicted to the gang controlled substance rapunzel. Day to day life became increasingly difficult for the future father as the addiction grew to unsustainable levels. Struggling, the father would have to find other methods other than paying for the substance with the little money they had… this would eventually cause him to take desperate measures.</p>

		<p>The husband would spent many hours worrying over his wife's condition as it progressively got worse and worse. The level of rapunzel now needed to maintain the wife’s addiction was beyond what they could afford, so the wife started having withdrawal symptoms. The first week the wife started to have cold sweats during her sleep, the husband worried and stayed up watching over her. After the sweats came the sleepless nights due to the nightmarish hallucinations keeping the husband on constant alert, worrying every second about her well-being. On the sixth week of the hellish withdrawal period the husband had finally had enough, he was going to get enough rapunzel to help calm his wife’s addiction and more importantly save the couples relationship. No matter what the cost…</p>
		<p>Outside the couple's flat consisted a network of narrow and complex corridors that connected the many other small dingy flats together, at key points of corridor connections there would usually be low level gang members distributing the drug needed to fulfill the wife’s dependency. Late one night, the husband ventured outside the flat to find one of these gang members.</p>
		<p>Block A consisted a network of narrow and complex corridors that connected the many other small dingy flats together with the couples. At key points where corridors would intersect there would usually be low level gang members distributing the drug needed to fulfill the wife’s dependency. Late one night, although unless you were located on the edges of the megacomplex you would have to trust your watch - the husband ventured outside the flat to find one of these gang members, his intentions were devious as he did not plan to pay the dealer… After the long trip through the maze he finally ended up at his destination, the dealers distribution point, “This is has to be the place”. He anxiously waits for the opportune moment to strike, his sinister plan involved taking what he needed by force. During a dry spell the dealer decided to watch some sort of video on what looked like a hand held device. The husband sneaked his way over approaching the dealer slowly tightly grasping his laser taser, he took aim and fired - A direct hit. He scurried over closing the last of the distance between them and searched the dealer for what he found, “Bingo, Just what I was looking for”.</p>

	<section>
		<p>The husband was victorious, he had achieved the crutches needed to escape another week of his wife's withdrawal terrors. After returning home, the husband started preparations to fulfill his wife's dependencies - the crackling noise from the preparations were canceled out due the wives insurfritible screaming. Three bangs, “The door?” thought the husband - Instantly after he heard a recognisable voice, “Now now, Don’t make be break the door down”. The husband hesitantly moved towards the door, doubtful of his safety muttered, “I’m sorry! I’ll give you back what we took” - Before the husband could even touch the door’s locking mechanism he was blown back from what he could only describe as a rocket to the face.</p>
		<p>“Do you mind if we come in?”, It was the druglord and a few of his goons - One of goons picked the husband to his feet and sat him on the bed where his suffering wife was lying down crying with pain. The drug lord took a look around whilst the two bulky men acted as a watch, keeping an eye on the husband and crippled wife, “Right so let’s keep this simple, give me back what you’ve taken and we might leave you with all your fingers”, the drug lord made his demand in an eloquent but malevolent manner - The husband replied stuttering “I-I Already S-Started prep-preparations”. The drug lord took a glance over at the couple's kitchen and then replied, “Well I guess the fingers are going on the chopping board”. The goons immediately reached for the man's wife, The man instinctively tried to stop them knowing fine well of what consequences would be dished out, “Take me!” He pleaded - “You? What would be the fun in that”, The goons pushed him to the floor revealing to the drug lord his pregnant wife, it was clear to him that she was suffering from withdrawals, “This must the be the motive for stealing my Rapunzel, You must value her life more than your own”, The druglord stared at her with his vicious gaze only to be interrupted by the husbands howl, “Please! She has our unborn child! Take me leave here out of this she had no part” - The goon punched the the husband in the gut, rendering him incapable of movement.</p>
		<p>The drug lord then gave the husband an ultimatum, “Either find me the money you owe me in exchange for forgiveness or face the consequences. ” - The consequences were known to the couple as the gang was notorious in block C.</p>

	</div>
	<section>
		<p>The ultimatum was given, the husband had to make a choice, either face the consequences or somehow come up with the money. The husband knew of the gang, the gang only known as ‘The Coyotes’ - They have total control over Block C, they ruled with an iron fist, punishing any who stepped up against them. The husband after witnessing his neighbours segmentation. They took his arms, legs, torso and head and placed up and down the corridor as a warning to others to not defy ‘The Coyotes’.</p>
		<p>The druglord approached the husband and crouched down to his level and said softly said, “I don’t have all day, If you can’t come up with the money I’ll be getting big John over here”, The husband looks over to one of the henchmen and notices him grasping an electrified object - sword shaped, The husband fears the worst has yet to come.</p>
		<p>The gang would rarely make their way down to the lower levels of the mega-complex as its condition were poor at best. Disease was rife, the mountains of trash concealed the solid steel walls, and packs of wild coyotes that make their way through the block from large entrances located at the bottom floor - taking anything left by the residents. The Coyotes, people believe the gang based their ideology on that of the wild animals themselves.</p>
		<p>A shining light came from the brutes weapon, as he raised his armed hand to the ceiling, “Please! Don’t hurt my wife, she's suffering already, please give us something to help her get through this”, Exclaimed the husband - The drug lord, ‘El Papi’, glanced back over towards the wife, “Hmm… How about this, I’ll give you a lifetime supply of Rapunzel for your unborn child?”. The husband looked stunned and was left with no choice… The agreement was made.</p>

		<p>Time came and went and the birth finally came, they had had a baby girl, not long after the birth came the inevitable - ‘The Coyotes’ eventually got wind of the event and snatched the baby from the couple. The child then grew to become a beautiful and attractive young women. ‘The Coyotes’ looked after their property very well, for one could not determine the difference between Rapunzel and that of a successful business woman, for she was dressed like this to appear inconspicuous. Rapunzel had splendid hair, as fine as spun gold, she was decorated in jewelry and the latest fashion trends, which was surprising, given that she transferred drugs for ‘The Coyotes’.</p>
		<p>Her living conditions were also relatively comfortable. Although she had a place to call her own, in a way it was a prison cell. She had no interaction with the outside world. The only time she could feel the warm grace of the sun on her face was in the morning before her ‘chores’ start. She would often stare out the window and look at all the little lights. It gave her hope that one day she would be free, to experience everything one should experience.</p>
